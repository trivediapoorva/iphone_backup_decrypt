# iphone-backup-decrypt

Decrypt an encrypted, local (i.e. non-iCloud), iPhone backup created from iOS13 or newer.
This code is mainly a [wrapper for this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/13793043),
itself based on the [iphone-dataprotection](https://code.google.com/p/iphone-dataprotection/) code.

## Install

Requires [Python 3.4](https://www.python.org/) or higher.

The code requires a cryptographic library providing the `Crypto` name. 
Use `pycryptodome` (but note that this clashes with `pycrypto`, if that is already installed).

The backup decryption keys are protected using 10 million rounds of PBKDF2 with SHA256, then 10 thousand further iterations of PBKDF2 with SHA-1.
To speed up decryption, `fastpbkdf2` is desirable; otherwise the code will fall back to using standard library functions.
The fallback is much slower, but does not require the complicated build and install of `fastpbkdf2`.

Ideal dependencies:
```shell script
pip install biplist pycryptodome fastpbkdf2
```

Minimal required dependencies (automatically installed):
```shell script
pip install biplist pycryptodome
```

Install directly from GitHub via `pip`:
```shell script
pip install git+https://github.com/trivediapoorva/iphone_backup_decrypt
# Optionally:
pip install fastpbkdf2
```

## Usage

This code decrypts the backup using the passphrase chosen when encrypted backups were enabled in iTunes.

The `relativePath` of the file(s) to be decrypted also needs to be known.
Very common files, like those for the call history or text message databases, can be found in the `RelativePath` class: e.g. use `RelativePath.CALL_HISTORY` instead of the full `Library/CallHistoryDB/CallHistory.storedata`.

If the relative path is not known, you can manually open the `Manifest.db` SQLite database and explore the `Files` table to find those of interest.
After creating the class, use the `EncryptedBackup.save_manifest_file(...)` method to store a decrypted version.

A minimal example to decrypt and extract some files might look like:
```python
from iphone_backup_decrypt import EncryptedBackup, RelativePath, RelativePathsLike

passphrase = "..."  # Or load passphrase more securely from stdin, or a file, etc.
backup_path = "%AppData%\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\\[device-specific-hash]"

backup = EncryptedBackup(backup_directory=backup_path, passphrase=passphrase)

# Extract the call history SQLite database:
backup.extract_file(relative_path=RelativePath.CALL_HISTORY, 
                    output_filename="./output/call_history.sqlite")

# Extract all photos from the camera roll:
backup.extract_files(relative_paths_like=RelativePathsLike.CAMERA_ROLL,
                     output_folder="./output/camera_roll")

# Extract WhatsApp SQLite database and attachments:
backup.extract_file(relative_path=RelativePath.WHATSAPP_MESSAGES,
                    output_filename="./output/whatsapp.sqlite")
backup.extract_files(relative_paths_like=RelativePathsLike.WHATSAPP_ATTACHMENTS,
                     output_folder="./output/whatsapp")
```
